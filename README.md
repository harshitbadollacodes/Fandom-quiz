# A small CLI Quiz App

Thanks for taking out time and reading this doc. 

This is a CLI (command line interface) quiz app. CLI apps are totally obsolete from the end user scene, but programmers use them all the time. 

<h1> What is CLI ?</h1>
When you interact with a program via command line, then it is a CLI app.

<h1> How to run a CLI App ? </h1>
Since this is a CLI app and uses node js, it cannot be run on browser. I have used Repl.it (online IDE) which allows to write code and build apps and websites using a browser. It allows to share the code easily.

<h1>How to interact with an user via the console? </h1>
I have used readline-sync which is a tool to have conversation with user via a console and that is how this CLI app works. 

<h1>How to style the console?</h1>
In order to style the console, I have used chalk library. It is amazing and easy to use to style the commands in the console. 

This is a basic CLI quiz app which I learnt to make by attending neogCamp.
